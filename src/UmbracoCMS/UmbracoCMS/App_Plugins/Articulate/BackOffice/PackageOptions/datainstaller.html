                    This will ensure that Articulate's schema (Document Types, Data Types, Media Types, etc...) is installed
                    correctly
                    and will install a default Blog into the root of your content tree.

                    <li>
                        If you've installed Articulate via Nuget you will need to use this to install the required Articulate
                        data
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        This will sync any new schema changes that Articulate requires with your existing schema if Articulate
                        is already installed
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        This will <strong>not</strong> remove any Property Types or Data Types that you've manually created on
                        top of the standard Articulate schema properties
                    </li>

                <p>
                    The installer has installed all of the required Umbraco nodes including some demo data.
                    You can either modify this demo data or simply remove it once you are comfortable with how Articulate works.
                    The demo data includes: a blog post, an author, a category and a tag.
